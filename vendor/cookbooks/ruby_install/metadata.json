{"name":"ruby_install","description":"Installs/Configures ruby-install","long_description":"ruby-install Chef Cookbook\n==========================\n\nInstalls [ruby-install][ruby-install], a simple way to build Rubies and\nthe natural companion to [chruby][chruby].\n\n[ruby-install][ruby-install] itself is responsible for getting and\ndependencies necessary for building a particular Ruby.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nCookbooks\n---------\n\nThe following cookbook is a direct dependency because it is used for\ncommon \"default\" functionality.\n\n* ark\n\nOn RHEL family distros, the \"yum\" cookbook is required for obtaining\nlatest dependencies for building Rubies.\n\nOn Debian family distros, the \"apt\" cookbooks is required for obtaining\nlatest dependencies for building Rubies.\n\nPlatform\n--------\n\nThe following platforms are supported and tested under test kitchen.\n\n* Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04\n* CentOS 5.8, 6.3\n\nOther Debian and RHEL family distributions are assumed to work.  Other\ndistributions that [ruby-install][ruby-install] supports should also\nwork, please [report][issues] any additional platforms so they can be\nadded.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nSimply include `recipe[ruby_install]` in your run_list to have\nruby-install installed.  You will also have access to the\n`ruby_install_ruby` resource.\n\nRecipes\n=======\n\ndefault\n-------\n\nInstalls the ruby-install codebase and initializes Chef to use the\nLightweight Resources and Providers ([LWRPs][lwrp]).\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\nversion\n-------\n\nThe version of ruby-install that will be installed.\n\nThe default is the current latest version 0.2.1\n\nchecksum\n--------\n\nsha256 checksum of the version to be installed, used for security.\n\nThe default is a checksum that matches up with the latest ruby-install.\n\ndefault_ruby_base_path\n----------------------\n\nThe default base path for installed Rubies.  For example the following\nresource:\n\n    ruby_install_ruby 'ruby 2.0.0-p247'\n\nwill be installed into \n`\"#{node['ruby_install']['default_ruby_base_path']}/ruby-2.0.0-p247\"`\n\nThe default is `\"/opt/rubies\"`.\n\nIf you are using ruby-install alongside [chruby][chruby] it expects, by\ndefault, to find Rubies in `/opt/rubies` or `~/.rubies`.\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\n* Source hosted at [GitHub][repo]\n* Report issues/Questions/Feature requests on [GitHub Issues][issues]\n\nPull requests are very welcome!
